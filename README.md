# Intro-to-Computer-Science

These are all the small programs I created for my course Intro to Computer Science using the programming language JAVA. I took this course in my freshman year

Overview of the course:
```
This course is a comprehensive introduction to the Java programming language teaching writing, testing and
debugging of programs. The course has three major parts. The first part teaches fundamental programming
techniques that use primitive data types, variables, assignments expressions and operators, control statements,
arrays and files I/O. The second part covers testing and debugging and teaches students how to write programs
that work reliably. The third part introduces object-oriented programming. The course guides students to the
development of comprehensive Java applications.
